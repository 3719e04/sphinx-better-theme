This is a modified version of the Sphinx default theme with the following
goals:

1. Remove frivolous colors, especially hard-coded ones
2. Improve readability by limiting width and using more whitespace
3. Encourage visual customization through CSS, not themeconf
4. Use semantic markup

So far, only goals 1 and 2 have been met. `Open a ticket` if you'd like
something changed.
