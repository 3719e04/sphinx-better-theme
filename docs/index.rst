Other themes to check out
-------------------------

`kr-sphinx-themes <https://github.com/kennethreitz/kr-sphinx-themes>`_ has two
nice, clean themes used for many popular (and nice-looking) projects.

`Cloud <http://pythonhosted.org/cloud_sptheme/cloud_theme.html>`_ is a nice,
feature-rich theme from which I plan to steal more than one feature.

A few different themes are available for download at
`sphinx-themes. <http://vkvn.github.io/sphinx-themes/>`_

`Read the Docs <https://readthedocs.org/>`_ uses a nice custom theme as the
default for all docs hosted there.

The `Guzzle <http://guzzlephp.org/>`_ project uses a `heavily customized
theme`_ that's also used by `aws-cli <http://aws.amazon.com/cli/>`_.

The `Julia language <https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliadoc>`_ also uses an
interesting custom theme.
