A Better Sphinx Default Theme
=============================

This is a modified version of the Sphinx default theme with the following
goals:

* Remove frivolous colors, especially hard-coded ones
* Improve readability by limiting width and using more whitespace
* Encourage visual customization through CSS, not themeconf

So far, only the first two goals have been met. [Open a ticket] if you'd like
something changed.
